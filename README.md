# BatesMotel
Description
This is a Project I create it in College.
We had to choose a character from a movie and develop first a mockup and then develop a real website.
I came out with the Idea of Norman Bates from Psyco the famous Hitchcock movie.
The form to book the rooms is actually working.
Was implemented with Jotform and I changed the layout and colors of it in CSS
Technologies Used:
